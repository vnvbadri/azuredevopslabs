## Sharing the Contents

As your team works together you'll undoubtedly have files that you'll want to share and collaborate on. Microsoft Teams makes it easy to share files within channels. If the files are Word, Excel. PowerPoint or Visio files your colleagues can even view, edit, and collaborate on the files right within Teams. For Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, they can see each others changes in almost real time.

1. Select **Files** and select **Upload** to share a document with the team. You can also use **Drag and drop** (Using your mouse, drag the file from where it's currently located and drop it on the Teams window among the files.) method to upload files.

1. You can also share the related websites within the Teams as Tabs. As we use **Wiki** to explain project objectives, epics, specs, release notes, best practices or other content to ensure all your team members and stakeholders learn, you can also share your Team's **[Wiki](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/devops/wiki/)** content as website within teams as tab. 

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps projects Wiki page. Copy the URL.

Now that you have connected Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps think about the other development team information that you can expose via Microsoft teams, for example: 

- [Add a OneNote notebook to Teams](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-a-OneNote-notebook-to-Teams-0ec78cc3-ba3b-4279-a88e-aa40af9865c2) to keep meeting notes such as **Sprint Planning Meetings** and **Retrospective Meetings**.

- [Connect Azure DevOps to Power BI ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/report/powerbi/?view=azure-devops) and [add a Power BI tab ](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-powerbi-tab-to-teams-708ce6fe-0318-40fa-80f5-e9174f841918) that displays advanced reports from Azure DevOps or other data related to your project.
