## Azure DevOps Kanban board & Dashboards in Teams 

Your Kanban board turns your backlog into an interactive signboard, providing a visual flow of work. As work progresses from idea to completion, you update the items on the board. Each column represents a work stage, and each card represents a user story (blue cards) or a bug (red cards) at that stage of work.

You can bring in your teams kanban board or favourite dashboard directly into Microsoft Teams.
These can be added using Tabs. **Tabs** allow team members to access your service on a dedicated canvas, within a channel or in user's personal app space. You can leverage your existing web app to create a great tab experience within Teams.

1. To bring your Kanban board or Dashboard into Microsoft Teams, click the **+** icon to add new tab. Find the Azure DevOps icon and select **Azure DevOps**
